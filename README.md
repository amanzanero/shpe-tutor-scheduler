# SHPE Study Nights Tutor Scheduler

## Description:

This is a simple webapp for booking appointments with other SHPE 
members who volunteer to be tutors for study nights. 

Users can make an account, choose their classes, and then see what
tutors are at their disposal. They will also be able to see who else
is taking the same courses as them!

## Motivation

Finding out who has taken what class can be frustrating. We want our 
members to be able to easily access both tutors and upper classmen 
who have taken the classes they are in!

## Tech Stack:

Mongodb, Express.js, React.js, Node.js 

## For contributing:
